No, not <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvwz1809v94'>CRONCH</a>, CRUNCH!

</div>

For the past week I've been debating what kind of post I wanted to
write up this week. I could stick to the usual development updates,
but things are going mostly according to plan - except for one thing.
Our team is bracing for the impact of back to back booked weekends,
which occur immediately before we present our vertical slice on Monday
the 19th. We have until Sunday the 18th to wrap up any remaining
changes, which means we only have half of our last sprint (our sprints
start on Thursdays). In addition, our next sprint is almost entirely
taken up by the Montreal International Game Summit (MIGS). Half of
our dev team (myself included) will be unable to work on development
for 4 of the sprint days, which happen to be a good chunk of the days
we usually make the most development progress. All that to day, we are
bracing for the impact of development slowing.

As I started to prepare for getting our game into a mostly bug-free
state and to a point in which QA could effectively run itself while
half the team is at MIGS. Unfortunately, I am also a Resident Assistant.
Often that is a good thing, as I love my job as an RA, but it so
happened that I am on duty (working 9pm-7am) everyday this week
(leading up to MIGS), except one. That night was last night.
Now, to some extent, I knew I'd be pulling a late night and needing
to get a lot of dev work done. I accepted that I may be pulling an
all-nighter at some point. That night was last night. My hours for this
sprint went from 27-ish to 45 over night. Forty-five hours is a lot,
even for a working professional (our sprints are a week long).

Taking a step away from my all-nighter, a lot of the discussion I
see going on around the games industry directly involves crunch,
overtime, and healthy work-life balance. Just a couple months ago,
Telltale let go of almost all, and then all, of their staff because
(from the sources I've read) the company was banking on one or a couple
deals to go through. Now Rockstar (known for Red Dead Redemption 1 & 2)
is in the communities thoughts with their statements of 100+ hour
work weeks and employees not being put in credits because they weren't
present for the full development period of a game, regardless of their
contributions. These conditions are terrifying to be watching and soon
participating in. Needless to say, crunch and culture have been on my
mind a lot lately.

Looking at the Game Studio culture at Champlain, we have a very close
knit community, much like any industry studio. We see each other
every or nearly-every day, talk about what one another are working on,
and joke about how long we are working on our projects. The closer
students get to the culminating project that is capstone, the more
serious these jokes become. We know we are pulling insane hours, that
this isn't exactly health, and yet we do it anyway.

Some students rationalize by thinking of a better future, one after
graduation where we work 9-5 and then we are done. We would have
free time after work, social lives to explore outside of the studio,
and time to actually *play* games. Sometimes its rationalized like
I did this past week. If only I can get past this hurdle, fix these
critical bugs and put in these player feedback features, then its ok.
These rationalizations are misplaced though. More and more we as
students are seeing parts of the industry struggling to put developers
first.

Our rationalizations do more damage than just misguiding our hopes.
Whether we realize it or not, our actions create our studio's culture.
How we interact with those we work with (regardless of if we like each
other or not) and what kind of hours we pull have a direct impact on
our peers. Especially as seniors, we set the bar both in product
quality and in studio expectations and culture.

To be clear, I am not trying to encourage the hours I pulled.
Dare I say, I have a fair amount of cognitive dissonance regarding last
night. On one hand, I am totally convinced it was necessary to get
everything done we had planned or needed to. There was a bit of poor
planning on my part and our team as a whole, but in the end, it was ok.
On the other hand however, I majorly contributed to the totally
unrealistic expectation that sometimes it is expected of students to
pull insane hours and work till they drop. I'm not the worst, this was
only the third all-nighter I have ever pulled (thee other two were for
a game networking class fall of junior year). I know a number of my
peers who also pull insane hours because working in the game studio
is difficult. Immensely rewarding, but a mental and physical challenge.

Studio culture matters. I'm sitting here in our college cafe, and I'm
seeing numerous peers come in and sit down to have lunch and find
myself wondering; how are they doing, what kind of hours have they had
to pull to make the kind of content they do, am I an outlier, or are
all of us internalizing the kind of hours we pull all for the sake of
making some truly amazing content? The Game Studio at Champlain, as
a whole, is wholesome and supportive and a phenomenal experience
to understand how the industry works. Like any industry studio, however,
we have similar issues. The culture we create isn't just the
camaraderie between peers or the helping each other out on projects.
It's also the work-life balance that encourage or discourage through
our behaviours.

Looking back at last night, I am starting to piece together how I
can avoid contributing to Champlain Game Studio crunch in the future.
Better planning, anticipating bug fixing, and limiting the hours that
I can work is critical to maintaining a healthy balance for myself and
my team. It was definitely a learning experience, for both the content
I was working on and the planning required to mitigate crunch further.
My team is going to continue working on making fantastic content,
and hopefully doing so after mid-year cuts (aahhh < 2 weeks!!).
Regardless of if we make the cut, we will be bringing not just our
development experience, but our critical thinking about planning to
whichever amazing game we work on.

I've processed a lot while writing this, but there is still more to do.
More critical thinking to be had, and productive conversations to have
with my peers in the studio about our culture. For now though, if you
are still reading this, you have heard me ramble enough. Time to get
back to the real world and re-engage with friends, residents, and
my team (even in my fatigued state :P).

Please do check out the blogs of my team below though, they are quite
stellar.
