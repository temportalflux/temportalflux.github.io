Another brief blog post today. The team is in short-term crunch mode
as we are putting in final feature changes before our pre-release
candidate is due. We have a soft code-freeze (all features stop being
actively changed) by the end of the day tomorrow. Thankfully,
we've been tracking all our bugs and feature changes in a spreadsheet
and have been chugging along ticking them off. Makes me want to go back
to using an actual ticket system like JIRA though. We are also filming
team members for our reel for the show today while we get more of these
tickets completed.
