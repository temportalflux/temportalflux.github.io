This week our team found our spring interrupted by Fall Break (a 4 day weekend). Our designer went away for the weekend,
and our artist has been hard at work on finishing round 1 on the modeling/skinning/rigging for the
player and antagonist characters. While I was able to do some programming to improve the player experience,
most of my focus this week has been redirected, once again, to documentation.

Our documentation thus far has been mostly formal. At Champlain, we have a number of docs due on milestones to
ensure the team and our faculty are on the same wavelength. For programmers, this was the technical design and
risk assessment. We are nearly halfway done the semester now (about 6 weeks until we present our prototypes and cuts are made).
So in preparation for our final leg of pre-production, the team decided to start crafting our transitional documentation.

Transitional docs are informal ways to onboard folks and guide developers on making more really cool stuff.
If our game makes it through cuts, these docs will encourage onboarding and make that process easier. These docs aren't
just for new team members though. I have been acting as the build owner, for the most part. If we have QA or our
weekly check-ins, I have been the one to always make the build. This is because I tend to do the final checks
on the status of the project, but also because I am the only one who knows the build process. Now with these docs,
how to build the project (among other things) is documented and other team members can make a build whenever they
want to.

For these docs, I showed the team [a sample ReadTheDocs site](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),
and the team loved the format. We have been used to difficult to write and read wiki's using Redmine, and ReadTheDocs
felt like a breath of fresh air.

Over the past week, I have written up docs on how to setup the project, making a build (see above), and writing new
documentation for read the docs. My favorite quote of of the latter being:

> What kind of documentation are you writing?
> Are you getting meta and using a documentation page to write documentation pages? Woof. /documentation would be a great place for that spooky 4th wall stuff.

That's all for this week. If you are interested in taking a peek at our informal documentation,

Keep an eye out for another post on YOGURT! I've got some pretty *slick* stuff in the works.
