Wow its almost been a full month since my last post. While there has
been a lot of time spent between then an now, not a lot has actually
happened with our project. Soon after alpha presentation, the
studio/school went on spring break, so we all took some time to
decompress. The week after almost the entire team attended
Game Developers Conference 2019. As of right now, we are a week out
from beta build being due, and just a day from presenting at
PaxEast 2019.

Big changes this past week involve getting the team on a stable
build pipeline and integrating art/effects as we approach beta.
Prior to alpha deadline, the team didn't really have a pipeline
for when or how we made builds. Since then I've pushed the team to
standardize this process, and have also been put in charge of making
these builds. I'd love to have this just run through Continuous
Integration, but alas we don't have the infrastructure for that.

In preparation for the "final" week of beta (really the only week),
the team re-examined our feature backlog and scoped features accordingly.
We are confident we can get most of it in, as the remaining features
primarily consist of integrating remaining art/effects and balancing
gameplay. That said, there are two features that may still be cut this
week. The first is streaming levels (getting rid of level load screens).
This is heavily dependent on the technology and if we think we can
use the level streaming system with almost no bugs. The second feature
is steam achievements, which are extremely dependent on if we can get
a steam account up and running and make those achievements in game.
If steam achievements don't happen for our primarily release though,
we are still intending on including it in a patch later on hopefully.

Highlight of my week though was definitely getting this wiggle boi
working.
