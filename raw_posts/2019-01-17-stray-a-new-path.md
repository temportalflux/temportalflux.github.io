Life has returned to Burlington, as college campuses have started
spring semester courses. With this new infusion of life comes the
determination to finish off our degrees. For seniors in the Game
Studio at Champlain College, this means Senior Production -
moving the games that made the cut last semester into full on
production, and hopefully release.
This semester, I have the privilege to work with a team of 13 others on
Stray: The Wayward Path.

# Ramping Up & Goals

This week is our first sprint of the semester, so the team is just
starting to ramp up work. We had class on Wednesday (1/16) and got our
tasks for the sprint organized. We have some work to do regarding
game narrative and how that meshes with the gameplay/world, but we do
have 3 meetings planned for this week. The original team is organizing
their documentation, then we have an all hands on deck meeting on
Saturday to talk about Greenlight. Greenlight is a milestone during
Senior Production in which the game must be stable and any systems that
need to be reworked should be reworked and finished. This prepares the
game for active development and new content as we enter Alpha and Beta
milestones. In last meeting, which the artists and designers are taking
point on, will address environment and world building. In parallel
with these meetings, various team members are preparing the project
itself for active development. This includes cleaning up the version
control, merging in the primary refactor branch (which I contributed
to over break in preparation for Greenlight), and preparing for meetings
to follow. Additionally, each team member is writing up a blog post this
week.

As it is the first week of classes (aka syllabus week), there isn't
a lot of work to be done. Well, compared to my usual work load that is.
Since I'm still a Resident Assistant here at Champlain, I've been taking
some of that "free time" to get some paperwork done in anticipation for
the coming mountain of work. If you would direct your attention to the
expertly drawn figure labeled "Work & Time", you will find a projection
of how much work there will be to be done, and how much free time I'll
actually have due to that work. The work displayed here incorporates
production work, along with the various other tasks and projects I'll
have to balance as the end of senior year approaches. It is going to be
quite the semester with lots to do, but taking some time away from work
will also be important to survival.

I am looking forward to development though! I'm excited about what
the world the team is crafting will look like, but I am even more
excited to explore my skills as an AI programmer and add some life
to the world by way of creatures and enemies. The team has started
looking at inspiration from others' artwork, as well as drawing ideas
from the narrative and world that is being built. One of my core
goals in creating some really authentic creatures will be basing their
behaviors around one or two core traits. For example, a creature which
is based around curiosity may pursue or follow players for a bit,
but ultimately stop if something else catches their attention. Perhaps
there are rabbit like creatures whose main trait is staying away from
larger creatures. Pairing this with up-and-coming technology in the AI
field like Utility Intelligence should help to make the creatures of
this world more authentic and believable. We have a
[pintrest board](https://www.pinterest.com/dustinyost/stray-the-wayward-parth/)
where I have been collecting inspirations for behaviors and creatures,
and you can see a few samples below.
