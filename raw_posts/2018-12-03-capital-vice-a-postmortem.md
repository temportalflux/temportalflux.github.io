Our new branding for the team
</center>
</div>

The past few weeks have flown by, but here I am, at the tail end of a
semester's worth of work a new beginning for other pieces of work.
A fair bit of crunch followed my last blog post, as my team prepared
for a lack of work due to the Montreal International Game Summit.
After which, we reconvened, prepared for our capstone presentations
and demo night, and braced for impact as we ran head first into cuts.
Unfortunately, our team did end up getting cut. The studio then took
a week break for Thanksgiving in the US. By the Friday following break,
cut teams have been redistributed to the remaining 6 teams (out of 15
that presented), and we are beginning the onboarding process. Before
onboarding can begin though, its time to reflect on the death of a
team and a project - a post-mortem if you will.

Thinking back on the semester, my team put our blood sweat and tears
into our game. We rapidly iterated and did our best to find the fun in
a concept that could be easily scalable. We weren't the only ones though.
Most of the teams put in similar amounts of time and effort into their
games, and only a fraction of the games actually passed the cut.

To some extent, this seems like a normal thing in industry. During the
Montreal International Game Summit, I attended the opening keynote,
where a panel hosted by [Anastasiya Bila](https://twitter.com/monkeyism)
where developers from across the industry talked "Failures and Triumphs:
The Never Ending Quest for Success". Folks on the panel talked about
cut after cut of games they would put their heart and soul into,
and yet the company decided not to push it forward.

Situations like these, like how Champlain does senior cuts, they are
hard. It's hard to put your project off to the side and move on.
This is the reality of the game industry though, and in that respect
I think Champlain is preparing its students well.

That said, there are some things the Game Studio does not address.
One of these is crunch, which I have
[posted about in the past](/posts/2018-11-08-culture-crunch-capstone).
The only thing I want to add to that reflection is that, as a senior,
there is immense standards to live up to. While Champlain prepares us
well to scope our games properly and have the chops to
design/art/program/produce well, there still lurks the underlying
expectation of quality that is only really achieved if you are pulling
20-40 hour weeks per team member - not to mention that the evaluation
of games isn't compared to the amount of team members a group has
or its team composition.

What I do want to reflect on now though, is communication and
transparency - both within our Game Studio at Champlain and in the
industry as a whole. Now, I acknowledge I have a limited field of view
when it comes to the industry. My experiences are limited to the
couple of studios I have interned at and the way I have witnessed
studios and developers communicate with their communities.

What I have experienced though, is incredible amounts of transparency
while working at [Disruptor Beam](https://www.disruptorbeam.com/).
Whether it was our weekly or daily meetings inside the company,
how the studio interacted with its player base, or how engaged their
developers were/are. They communicate frequently and in-depth with
their community and encourage the same communication within teams,
across teams, and throughout the company.

From the standpoint of a member of a game community, I have experienced
[Rare LTD](https://www.rare.co.uk/) doing the same thing. As a studio
running a LiveOps game (Sea of Thieves), Rare ensures that it is in
constant communication with their players. From
[weekly developer updates](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL51podOC3ZN2T96HeF4h-iLSFzDWNmiVh)
(which I absolutely love watching and listening as a developer) to
their [weekly streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL51podOC3ZN3iny3rSzPulBiJqoDW6Iv6)
to their pioneering testers to even how their developers interact
with each other and the community on twitter - Rare seems to be doing
a lot of things right.

From the experience of a senior in Champlain's Game Studio though,
I definitely witness a lacking in portions of the communication and
transparency between students and faculty. Don't get me wrong, the
studio is great at communicating as a whole to folks outside the studio,
and the faculty are great mentors when it comes to managing team
dynamics or learning technical knowledge in our fields. Cuts and
senior team formation, however, is in stark contrast. There is
no communication or transparency about that process, and the little
bit that seeps out as rumors or coming straight from professors after
the fact highlights that the criteria the studio heads (faculty)
say is important is never actually taken into account.

This isn't to say that the process is bad or doesn't come out with
some amazing teams and games. If you have seen anything
Champlain seniors crank out by the Senior Show in the past couple years,
lets just say it is nothing short of astounding (by student standards).
There is always room for improvement though. Whereas crunch can be
mitigated in industry with better management, I firmly believe
the struggles seniors go through in capstone surrounding cuts can be
mitigated by more transparency and communication. This is a precedent
that is being set by the industry as a new standard. If Champlain
is to stay at the forefront and continue to prepare its students well
for the experiences we will have in industry, then continuing to
improve and strive to give students the best experience possible is
paramount.
