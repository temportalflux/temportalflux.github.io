The past few weeks have flown by, but here I am, at the tail end of a semester's worth of work a new beginning for other pieces of work. A fair bit of crunch followed my last blog post, as my team prepared for a lack of work due to the Montreal International Game Summit. After which, we reconveined, prepared for our capstone presentations and demo night, and braced for impact as we ran head first into cuts. Unfortunately, our team did end up getting cut. The studio then took a week break for Thanksgiving in the US. By the Friday following break, cut teams have been redistributed to the remaining 6 teams (out of 15 that presented), and we are beginning the onboarding process. Before onboarding can begin though, its time to reflect on the death of a team and a project - a post-mortem if you will.
