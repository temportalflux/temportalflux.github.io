Well this isn't tool development talk, but I've got one better: eating prototypes. Yes, literally eating prototypes. Ok, maybe not literally, but my team cranked out some impresive content this week. After presenting out concepts last week, we were tasked with developing some prototypes to prove that our concepts are fun and will work. After presentations, the team decided that we wanted to run prototypes on 3 different variants of similar dynamic-role based mechanics.

# Prototypes

## Codename: Florida Man

Our artist, Ellie Peak, headed up our physical prototyping this week. She took our original idea of multiple roles pinned against each other and made an activity for QA testers. This involved small booklets which descriped a list of tasks for a player to complete within a timeframe. At the end of each round, points were totaled, based on how many tasks each player was able to complete. A player's task list, however, conflicted with other players', leaving them to prioritized certain tasks.

## Chaos Coven

Our second prototype is much easier to show here in a digital form. I was able to get basic networking up and running in Unity, and thus the first iteration of Chaos Coven was born. In this prototype, four players are pit against one another in a battle to destroy everything in sight. The twist? only "chaos" (the pink player) can destroy things. If a player is a coven member (purple), their task was to defeat "chaos" and take the role for themselves. The player who is able to finish destroying the environment as "chaos" wins. I recorded a small demo, where I play as 2 separate players (2 different computers) in the same world.

# Looking forward

We learned a bit from these two prototypes. Despite the havoc that ensued from playtesters running around the lab and the bugs we discovered in Chaos Coven, we found that our ideas were indeed fun and really engaged players. Our goal for next week is to do another round of prototyping. Unlike this past week, however, we are looking to the future when working in the days to follow. Part of the development of Chaos Coven (our favorite iteration of these dynamic role mechanics) involves a world which is intentionally designed and artistically engaging. This has led us to the decision of using Unreal Engine. All our digital prototype work is currently in Unity, so the following weeks will be planned with the knowledge of knowing where we want this road to go. For now, we present what we have tomorrow, and I'll be putting up a post next week.
