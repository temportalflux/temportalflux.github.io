I don't know how, but it is already 2 weeks until we make the final
build of Stray: The Wayward Path - the final development build that is.
Come the 24th, we will have the first confirmed fully stable releasable
build. Release number? probably somewhere in the v1.0.x range!

This has been a wild ride though. The most recent weeks in particular.
We hit beta just after I made my last post, and of course we passed
beta as well. Nearly had a full system overhaul in there, but I
determined it wasn't worth the effort and we found a less elegant
solution to prohibiting player input in dialogue/cutscenes.
We do have one more last minute feature that is being crunched on a
little bit, and that is level streaming. In this context, level
streaming for Stray means no load screens between our levels. It
nearly got cut too! The meeting for doing this kept getting pushed
back due to scheduling and that starting this work meant locking all
the maps in the repo while the designers and a programmer re-worked
the entire level/map system. Luckily, it is mostly in now, though
with a couple new bugs to be worked out. Overall, I've been in almost
a purely bugfix mode. Helping the team and project where I can and
ensuring our builds are stable.

A bit of a personal reflection as the year wraps up (only 31 days until
graduation now - that is absolutely terrifying). I've found that when
I am able to live a balanced life, I tend to gravitate towards helping
others and making lives easier where I can. Regrettably, I haven't
been able to keep this as a top priority during school as there is so
much else to be done. Looking forward towards, hopefully, a career in
the games industry, I hope to pursue an engineering life in making
cool game features with amazing people and perhaps dabbling in tools
when the opportunity presents. I love enabling players and other devs
both with crafting gameplay experiences <i>and</i> crafting developer
experiences.
