Wow, the end is finally here. Hard to believe that its already been 4 years at Champlain College, and now it is finals
week, and I've had a nasty virus for 2 weeks. In the past couple months, I've worked with a phenomenal team on
Stray: The Wayward Path and growing along the way. Unfortunately, due to a sickness I'm actively dealing with right
now, I was unable to attend the team postmortem a couple days ago.

While living and working here, I've grown a lot as a developer, and thereby communicator as well. I've learned a lot
in my technical field, but also when communicating and collaborating with my teams. I've developed a drive to learn
both my craft and from my team members. I've developed an intuition for anticipating the neads of my team before they
arise and managing scope.

Also incredibly important has been finding ways to lead and support my teams from non-leadership
roles. Through my experiences, my greatest strengths now reside in how I communicate with others and my drive to learn
more from others, within and outside of my craft.

That said, I'm always looking for areas where I need to improve. Right now the area I need to improve the most in is
seeking out and providing meaningful feedback from/to others. Without meaningful feedback, I wont be able to continuing
growing and learning with peers in industry.

I've learned a couple key things from my time at Champlain and working on Stray. For a team to collaborate effectifuly
and enjoy doing so, it takes a team who actively communicates, trusts one another, and for everyone to have a drive to
learn from one another. Personally, one of the biggest takeaways I have from this year has been to always give others
the benefit of the doubt, especially when all are stressed.
