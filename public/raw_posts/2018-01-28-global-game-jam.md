<h2>Global Game Jam 2018</h2>

Staying up 48 (nearly) 48 hours. Sleep is replaced by food and caffeine. Great games are made, and great concepts fail – and every single time, hilarity ensues.

Writing this coming out of my first game jam feels very strange. Of the great games are made, and great concepts fail category, my team fell into the latter category. For us, Global Game Jam started Friday, January 26th at 5pm. We congregated in one of the classrooms on Champlain campus and awaited the announcement of the jam’s theme. As game developing college students do, we waited by listening to game soundtracks and talking about our production games (more on that soon).

By 5:30pm, we had our theme: Transmission. Oof, what a concept. Just like that, we were off. Some teams went to claim labs on the floor, others to other buildings, and some home. My team (a designer, two artists, and myself) were already down one person. One of our artists was sick with the flu at home. Since they still wanted to take part, though, we had them on discord chat for the next 2 days.

So, we started with concept generation. Ten minutes, 30 concepts. Then eight minutes, 20 concepts. Finally, another eight minutes and 15 concepts later, we had our top picks. After a bit of debate, we narrowed it down to “heater w/ legs in winter”, no joke, that was our concept line. Next, fleshing out the concept. We dove into how the heater moves around, what the goal is, etc. for the next 30-45 minutes. What we decided on was a fire spirit in an oven (<a href="http://howlscastle.wikia.com/wiki/Calcifer">like Calcifer</a>), who was attempting to find their friends in a frozen spirit world (3D level). The theme came into play in two-fold, the character was supposed to be able to melt (transmit heat to) snow, and when interacting with spirits (entities), they would defrost, and you would comfort them with love (transmitting love) to improve their spirits (emotions). It wasn’t till much later that we recognized that scope would be a problem, especially with being down an artist.

Anyway, this began development. I had a host of systems to create, including a dialogue framework, 3D character movement, health/heat, and visual effects (via shaders). Our designer struggled for a while the first night, as finding a way to make the game engaging quickly became an issue. That, and our designer had little to no experience with narrative. Overall, we didn’t play to all the team’s strengths, we probably should have. Rather, we were more interested in following our goal, to learn and grow as developers – and have a ton of fun. We took a break around 12-1am that night, having completed the main character model, and getting the basic systems for movement and dialogue in.

Next morning, and what became our final day of development. Started early and got Denny’s (thank goodness for school vans) and returned to the labs to put in the bulk of our game. Our two artists (one on site and one remoting in via discord and git), started churning out assets. Really amazing stuff, given it being 3D and the crunch time that is natural to Game Jams. Our designer came back from evening creative design with concepts for ice and enemies, so I implanted basic mechanics for ranged enemies (snowmen). Our remoting artist took the character model and animated it. The entire room loved the wiggled (gif below of it untextured). Lots of fun was had that day, and a lot of stress.

As the evening got closer, it became more and more apparent that the demo we wanted to make was way out of scope in all three disciplines for our timeframe – and none of us were particularly thrilled by the idea of pulling an all-nighter given upcoming school milestones. I had more mechanics and systems and visual effects on my plate than I knew what to do with at this point. We had the outline for algorithms which would make the player look like they were icing over, for defrosting NPCs, and other effects. Our designer was working on the bulk of the narrative and still had to get through level designing. Our artists, still churning out models and textures, were starting to get bogged down. None of that even considers the various program crashes that started occurring around midday Saturday, everything from Unity to Maya.

By the time midnight rolled around, we had a wonderful character, but the rest of the game was just not looking great. We just didn’t have the time or forethought on how we were going to marry the art, design, and mechanics required to pull the game off. Thus, we decided to call time of death at 1am Saturday. Just about 24 hours of development (out of the 36ish available – if teams had pulled all-nighters). It was an amazing journey, and as a programmer, I learned a lot about integrating 3D models, where to put data (ScriptableObjects vs MonoBehaviour and their interactions), Unity shaders, and creating entire dialogue systems (and rewriting them almost twice).

Note, in this gif, the render was messed with by my gif recorder.

Sunday rolled around, and around noon we returned to the group. Our designer and on-site artist were too overwhelmed by other work, or just plain exhausted to make it in, so myself and our flu-artist came to the presentations. All the teams who presented did phenomenal work. There was a mars-rover game dubbed “Opportunity Knocks”, a meme-y rhythm game based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TcLxlkc2pA">"lemme smash" meme</a>, a satellite resource management game with shading styles similar to Borderlands, and a 2.5D platforming game based on trying to find reception to download an image of nood(le)s. Some amazing stuff was made. When it came time for Triplet4 (our team) to present, I was nervous of presenting a failure. So I prefaced with the intention and concept we wanted to do, and how we didn’t quite get to our goal. Our wiggly-boi (main character) was so well received, and a couple seconded someone saying how a game-jam game is only a failure if you don’t present. Overall, my team and I had so much fun creating the trashbin of a demo, and we learned a ton about short-term to long-term game development. Beyond all that, though, I think we learned the most about our strengths, even more about our weaknesses, and especially where our limits are. Scope is ever important as well. Our game is presently up on the <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/hearthold">Game Jam site</a>, although its only for our main character really.
