Our team has been hard at work cranking out bug fixes, minor level
adjustments, and making our pre-release candidate. We pushed the
candidate Tuesday evening, and passed pre-release yesterday.
Now we have entered the final stride towards the final release and
senior show! On top of actual game development, the team has been
chugging away at our trailer and reel in preparation for release.
Unfortunately, these are quite ready for release yet, so I can't link
them quite yet ;D
More to come soon!
