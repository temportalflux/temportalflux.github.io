Its week 2 & spring 2 of semester 2 in Stray: The Wayward Path development.
For us here at Justice Pork Games, that mostly means meetings. Lots
and lots of meetings. Well, a mediocre amount of meetings.

# Sprint 1: Wrap-up

Over week 1, the team got together a number of times through the week
to discuss topics like gameplay, narrative, art pipeline, and various
discipline's division of labor. The who's-doing-what was particularly
important because we have between 3 and 4 team members per discipline,
and we want to not only utilize our folks effectively, but give
everyone the opportunity to do the kind of work that they want to market
themselves for. For me, that means I get to work on the creatures
which populate our world and their behaviors \o/!

# Sprint 2: Abilities & Creatures

Kicking off sprint 2, the team discussed what kind of abilities we
want to add in the game for the player to use to navigate or defend
themselves in the world. We eventually narrowed this down to 3 new
abilities, in addition to the grappling and attacks that are already in.
These are;
a gliding ability which will give the players more hang time,
a ground pound which will get the players to the ground faster or
deal damage to a group of enemies,
and a shield to protect the player from ranged or nearby enemies.

Also, we just wrapped up our first creature meeting today. Coming
into the semester, the team knew that we wanted a couple new
enemies, that we needed to tweak the two existing, and that we would
like to add some passive creatures to populate the world if time permits.
After a fair bit of debate and thinking about what kind of challenges
we want the player to encounter, we decided on 3 new enemies that
we need to get in for Alpha (5 weeks from now). The total of 5 enemies
will be introduced to the player over the course of 3 areas, with the
fourth area culminating in a yet-undetermined boss battle.

My task for the next few weeks is to get these creatures to behave
in a way which a player will believe the creatures could actually be
real and have some kind of motivation behind their actions. As such,
I want the behaviors of these enemies to feel cohesive. While they
may not necessarily exhibit actions which looks human, their actions
should all make sense for a creature with a motivation. And the player
should have fun in combat with these creatures. Mostly have fun - that's
why the player is here.

## Sting/Wind Rays

As it stands, the Sting-Ray enemy doesn't so much sting as much as
use projectile wind gusts. Guess you could call it a Wind-Ray then, eh?
Additionally, they float - not fly. Unlike their passive counter-parts,
the manta-birbs (yes <b>birbs</b>) and manta-rays, which actually fly,
these creatures have always been near the ground with the Urchins.
This was primarily due to the scope of creating flying AI and needing
to push that off till active production. Well, now the project is in
production and it is time to revamp its behaviors. This creature will
be the first of 2 confirmed flying creatures.

I don't have a specific motivation nailed down quite yet - after all,
we just had the creature meeting today. I have some thoughts on making
it like a bat, with a sonic attack. This would replace the wind gusts,
and still maintain the design of having a ranged attack. The ray is
modelled off of a sting-ray, so does it's tail have a stinger on it?
If so, perhaps a melee or swooping attack would work well here.

Lots to think about here - more wil come with time ;)

## Urchins

Formerly styled after
[Banelings](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Baneling),
the Urchin currently charges the player, starting a detonation sequence
when they get close enough to the player. If the player is within range
when it explodes, the explosion deals damage to the player.
Actually a lot like
[Minecraft's Creeper](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Creeper).
Regardless of if it is killed by player or on detonation, the Baneling will die.

I refuse to believe, however, even if a creature in our fictional
world has been corrupted, that it would willingly run into a suicide
charge unless it was an absolute last resort AND it had some way for
its species to survive, like spreading spores which would grow.
I brought this up in our creatures meeting and folks ended up agreeing,
at least in this case. After all, we only have a couple weeks and you
can't make <i><b>every</b></i> creature authentic AND within scope...
or can you? ðŸ¤”

I plan to do some more thinking on the motivation behind this creature,
but for the time being, self-replication sounds mighty intriguing.
Almost akin to the
[Borg](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Borg) or
[Cybermen](https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberman),
except biological. So plants. The Urchin creature is now a plant.

## Golems

A golem or two have definitely been a team favorite for a good while now.
They were the first we decided we wanted to add in some shape or form,
and the golem concept art to the right is definitely my favorite
(that I've found on the
[interwebs/pintrest](https://www.pinterest.com/dustinyost/stray-the-wayward-parth/)).

There are no nailed down behaviors for these folks quite yet.
We know they are going to be introduced in the lost ruins level,
and may actually have a more dusty or crumbling look to them. In true
golem form, I've been leaning towards something that is more defensive
in nature. That doesn't limit it from being hostile on sight,
but perhaps golems are guardians of the ruins or something along
those lines.

The team did start thinking of possible attacks, and actually got
some inspiration from [Dauntless' Skorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcSdsG37Alc).
Take a look at some of those rock-moving attacks. Pretty nifty, huh?

## Barnacle

The concept for Barnacles (or clam as our Lead Designer would have it)
originated from wanting to have some sort of enemy which is a stationary
threat, and pulls from similar behaviors that the player exhibits.
Think of a cross between a Venus Fly Trap, frog, spore/shroom,
and [Stranger Things' Demogorgon](https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/The_Demogorgon).

A spore-like plant which sits on the sides of cliffs, and when a player
approaches, it opens its mouth/pokey-petals, shoots out a tongue, and
pulls the player to it. I expect its main motivation to come out to raw
carnivorous hunger. The curious part about this though, is that if
the Barnacle is carnivorous, what keeps it from eating other creatures
in the world? Does it have a digestive period? How does its digestion
affect the environment around it? If it is corrupted like all other
hostile enemies, what behaviors would an uncorrupted Barnacle exhibit?
Things to think on...

## Sneagle

No, not [Smeagol/Gollum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum).
That's copyright.
Sneagle - A snake with the head of an eagle.
This is our second flying enemy, and will likely be introduced during
the mountain level. Given that eagles are naturally predatory,
and snakes too, I'd imagine it wouldn't be difficult for players to
assume the Sneagle is also predatory. Perhaps Sneagles prey on other
creatures in the world.

No core behaviors laid out yet. I expect that most of the those
ideas will be heavily inspired by the design of the creature by
our art team, and thus this will probably be one of the last creatures
I tackle. I'd love to have Sneagles swoop into players or dive into
cracks in the world though. Kind of like dolphins in water
or [Ori and the Blind Forest's Mortar Worm](https://oriandtheblindforest.fandom.com/wiki/Enemies_of_Nibel).
Except Sneagles can also fly.... Lots to think about with this creature.

## Other creatures

That's just the tip of the ice berg. There are hopefully a boss and
passive creatures to come, scope permitting. Some top ideas for
passive creatures include skywhales, frogs, fox/rabbit/rodents,
friendly golems/passive versions of the corrupted enemies, among others.
