While assisting in the continued development of *[SensorConnect](/projects/05_sensorconnect)*, I was tasked with the creation of a interactable demonstration. This interactive game demo needed to take the input from various LORD Microstrain sensors, and convert that input into something the user can see/experience. This resulted in the creation of a demonstration later used for a Google expo.

While virtual unusable without the LORD sensors, I was allowed to record a demontration of the game-simulation and take the source with me.
The following is a then fellow intern demonstrating the usage of the LORD Sensors.
