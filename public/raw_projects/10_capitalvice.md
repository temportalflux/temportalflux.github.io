Capital Vice is a Thirdperson multiplayer competitive game where players are stage acts at a casino. As a player, your
goal is to amass wealth by controlling the spirit of Greed.

Players are able to take control of Greed and collect coin chip bags from various props in the world, and cash these
bags in for points to win ($$$). First player to get to $1M wins the match. The player embodying Greed has to be careful,
however, as other players are able to hurt them and thereby take Greed for themselves.
