Stray is an action-adventure game wherein you play as a derelict boy searching for his
lost friend and caregiver. Armed with a mechanical ... arm, you must take on the corrupted wildlife
and unforgiving environment in an effort to purify the land and uncover the truth surrounding her sudden disappearance.

I joined the Justice Pork Games team in January 2019. Throughout production, I contributed work on the
realistic enemies and artificial intelligence. I focused on utilizing UtilityAI in tandem with state machines.

This is an on going project.
