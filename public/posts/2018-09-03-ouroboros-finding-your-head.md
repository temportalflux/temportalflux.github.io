Capstone for Champlain seniors in the Game Studio means, for most, a year of building a full-fledged game from
conceptualizing to prototyping to active development. My team is starting with four developers (myself included).
We've got Cody Douglas as our producer, Ellie Peak on art, Conor Tully on design, and myself on engineering.

## Conceptualizing

Its going to be a full year! This week we have been tasked by our executive producer (prof. Greg Bemis) to come up
with 10 concepts, at least. Luckily for Ouroboros Creations, we have been developing a list of ideas over the course
of the summer, knowing we'd have to have something solid once the year began. Most of this process was the team
spitting out weird or unique ideas team members had over the summer into a group chat and google doc. As we chatted
more about each idea, we fleshed them out a little bit, but often fell short and either 1 person would love the idea
or no one was really sold on it. Our team composition, through our past experiences working with each other,
tends to gain its stride after the conceptualization phase when we have set tasks that have been committed to.

In addition to that list of 10+ ideas (our deliverable for this week), we decided we wanted to 3 solid concepts
that we are interested in following through with. This led to the great bottleneck - which concepts could we fall in
love with. Since most of our concepts were thus far, bare-bones, we filtered based on what concepts we could further
flesh out. This showed which ideas we were excited about. Below are the three concepts which the team got most
excited about while contextualizing.

## Concepts

### Codename: Chupacabra

A 3D platformer based off of 90's platformers where the player is some mysterious creature whose sole goal is to
collect as much of some item as possible. A couple possible settings could be a chupacabra on cinco de mayo or
bigfoot on halloween.

### Codename: Bastard Captain

You are a captain on a cruise ship who is sick of their job. Luckily, there is an ice berg on the horizon. Your goal?
Set the ship on a collision course and find the best way off the ship without inciting panic in your crew or passengers.
If you are spotted, scare a guest, or otherwise alert others on the ship, you must start over. You are stuck in
a groundhog's day-esk work until you successfully get off the ship.

### Codename: Florida-Man

Imagine: a beautiful island resort where everyone comes to find their happiness - but everyoneâ€™s idea of happiness
is <i>very</i> different. You and 3 other players are pit against one another on an island resort. Over the course of
15 minutes, each of you are assigned different roles. These roles change over the course of the play session.
Perhaps one player is the plucky island resort manager, who just wants to keep their hotel clean, neat, and operational.
Or, maybe you are assigned the role of the visiting neighbor. As the visiting neighbor, you want to experience everything the resort has to
offer. Player 3 got the confused and chaos driven tourist, and you just want to cause as much chaos as possible.
Player 4 got the child. They just want to go down the slide. As much as possible. Every time a player completes a task
given to them (for their role), they get points. The person with the most points at the end wins the session.

## Looking Forward

The year is going to be an exciting time. Many Quality Assurance lie ahead, not to mention GUR tool development
(for my independent study). We are tasked with making these blog posts every week, which will be good to get into the
habit of! So you can expect a blog post around this time next week as well. Teaser: it will be related to
concept feedback, the systems and mechanics of a prototype, and possible plans for a Games-User-Research tool set.
