I'm Dustin Yost, a programmer fresh to the game industry, but not as fresh to the software development world.
Presently, I am study Game Programming and Mathematics at Champlain College in the ever awe-inspiring Burlington Vermont.
I'm super enthusiastic about [Making Stuff Look Good in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEklP9iLcpExB8vp_fWQseg/videos),
Artificial Intelligence (specifically Flocking/Emergent behaviors), Procedural Generation, and alternative input schemes.
I started my days as a programmer back in middle school, where I started learning Java in conjunction with Minecraft modding.
Since then, I have progressed through C++, Unity + C#, Unreal Engine 4+, and various other languages. Sometimes I look back on these
days with fondness, especially since that point, my life has never been the same.

I lead a very busy life at Champlain, though I wouldn't have it any other way. Aside from my studies, I work as a Resident Assistant
to be a resource and friend to incoming students (younglings if you will). I am also deeply involved in the Information Technology and Sciences
department. I serve as a Student Government Association representative for the ITS department, where in I provide support and enthusiasm for our
many ITS related clubs on campus. I also work with the ITS department to get various iniatives up and running.

Taking a step away from the more professional and work related activities, I'm invovled a lot in other parts of life on campus. I drive and climb
with Champlain's Rock Climbing club, participate in Dungeons and Dragons campaigns/one-offs (5e and homebrew), and occasionally exist as a workaholic.
Yes, workaholic. This includes working with a host of peers on a side-project presently dubbed Good Fun Games (or GoFuG). Our project is presently
under super-secret status, and is presently referred to as Yellow-Butt-Ladybug.
