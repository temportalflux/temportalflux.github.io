_Dreamtime_, also called The Dreaming, introduces the player to a vital concept from Australian Aboriginal culture. This realm is deeply tied to the physical geography of the land, and it exists in a state that can be considered before time began, or all of time. The player has the ability to access different animal dreamings, like a kangaroo or a fire ant, and can change forms to access these. These characters allow the player to further explore the map. The player will also stumble across different folk tales in the world. The art style will be based on aboriginal art, and will aim to have the same style and feel of it. In a classroom, kids will be able to experience these folk tales in a hands-on way in the game, and then hear the full stories from their teacher. The goal is to create an immersive experience that educates children about some of the beliefs of Australian aboriginal culture without the kids feeling like they're being taught.
