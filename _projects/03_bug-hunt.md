In _Peter Wehr's Bug Hunt_ the player is dropped into a post apocalyptic wasteland. The player assumes the role of a post apocalyptic hero who is on the hunt to eliminate the ruthless aliens that are trying to devour the last of humanity and take over planet Earth. The player will be controlling a Jeep with a steering wheel in one hand and will be shooting with the other hand. We are using a retro, pixelated, post-apocalyptic art style. This is complimented by the use of mode7 to really capture that old arcade feel.
