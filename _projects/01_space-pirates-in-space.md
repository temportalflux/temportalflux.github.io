_Space Pirates In Space_ is a mobile turn based strategy game where both players are trying to take down the enemy’s crew or kill the enemy’s Captain with your highly effective highly intoxicated (whether it be intoxicated on life or rum) crew. The crisp, light-hearted, simplistic design of the characters and board makes it so the player can focus on the strategy and placement of the units.
