In this world, you assume control of a crew of steampunk sky pirates, shoot down merchants, collect their loot to upgrade your ship, run from the Royal Navy, and conquer the fort in order to become the most fearsome pirate captain in the skies.

For the first half of development, I served as the only programmer on the team. As such, I worked on all core gameplay
systems. I worked with our designer and artists to streamline our pipeline so that it was easier for them to
flesh out the world. I also developed the core AI to enemy ships.

In the second half of development, we brought on some team members and I worked along side an additional programmer.
We split up tasks according to our proficiencies, and I was able to fine tune some of the enemy AI. I also worked
with our new combat designer to update player controller to deliver a more enjoyable player experience.
