Stray is an action-adventure game wherein you play as a derelict boy searching for his
lost friend and caregiver. Armed with a mechanical arm, you must take on the corrupted wildlife
and unforgiving environment in an effort to purify the land and uncover the truth surrounding her sudden disappearance.

I joined the Justice Pork Games team in January 2019. While working on Stray: They Wayward Path,
I took ownership of the creature features, iterating heavily on AI for everything from
the simple Urchins to the complex behaviors of the final boss. My goal in this work
was always to get to a point in which the creatures which surround the player seem
believable, both in terms of their context and their actions. I also took on responsibility of
handling our build pipeline, ensure that player-facing builds had everything packaged properly,
when through testing, and included proper versioning and changelists.
