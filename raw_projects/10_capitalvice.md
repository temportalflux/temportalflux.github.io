Capital Vice is a Thirdperson multiplayer competitive game where players are stage acts at a casino. As a player, your
goal is to amass wealth by controlling the spirit of Greed.

Players are able to take control of Greed and collect coin chip bags from various props in the world, and cash these
bags in for points to win ($$$). First player to get to $1M wins the match. The player embodying Greed has to be careful,
however, as other players are able to hurt them and thereby take Greed for themselves.

As the only programmer on the team, my contributions spanned the game.
I worked on the pipeline with our artist and designer so they had an easier time working on the environment
so that it felt realistic. I also fixed most of the bugs that cropped up in our QA sessions. The game was
tested for bugs, playability, player experience 3 times a week, so these reports had to be iterated on rapidly.
As such, we implemented a variant of the RITE method.
Most of my focus went to the gameplay, as we used a new plugin called the
[Gameplay Ability System](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Gameplay/GameplayAbilitySystem).
This was a new tool for the team, so for pre-production, I worked hand in hand with our designer to tweak
gameplay abilities and improve their usage and playability.
